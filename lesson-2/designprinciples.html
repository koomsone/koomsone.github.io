		<p> Alignment refers to the manner in which text and graphics are displayed on the page. Alignment generates order, defines groups of items, organizes page elements, and emphasizes visual connections.
			Interestingly, good alignment is rarely seen by the reader, whereas misalignment is noticed immediately.
			There are two basic alignment types: the middle and the edge. Center orientation can be horizontal or vertical. he edges can be aligned around the top, bottom, left or right edges. When designing a website, be sure that each feature (text, graphics, photographs) is visually aligned to another object.
			The principle of alignment states; "There is nothing to be randomly put on the page. Any object on the page should have a visual link to something else." When the objects are aligned, the result is a greater unit of cohesion. The key aim of alignment is to unify and coordinate the page.

				<p> Contrast is the most powerful way to bring visual appeal to the website. Contrast is also vital to the organizing of information. A reader should still be able to look at a text and immediately understand what's going on.
			Add contrast with your preference of typefaces, line thicknesses, spaces, colours, forms, proportions etc.
			Contrast has two primary purposes:
			To build a curiosity on the web-if a page is fun to look at, it's more likely to be read.
			To assist in the organizing of the information-the message should be simple and readily identifiable.
			When you take a closer look at the navigation bar. You can see that, the menu text standsout from the navigation and this add visual excitement to the page.

		<p> Proximity defines the distance between the design components.
			Proximity means the interaction between the elements; on the other hand, lack of proximity distinguishes them.
			Like Alignment, proximity is a visual organizing tool. The key aim of proximity is to organize. Simply grouping the associated elements together into closer proximity generates an organization immediately. If the information is structured, then it is more likely to be read, and It's more apt to be noticed.
			Placing the elements in close proximity unites them and expresses a sense of balance and organization to the reader.
			The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints web site is a great example of proximity.
